/**
 * A StitchServiceError is an exception indicating that an error came from the Stitch server
 * after a request was completed, with an error message and an error code defined in the
 * {@link StitchServiceErrorCode} enum.
 *
 * It is possible that the error code will be 
 * {@link StitchServiceErrorCode.Unknown}, which can mean one of several
 * possibilities: the Stitch server returned a message that this version of the SDK does not yet
 * recognize, the server is not a Stitch server and returned an unexpected message, or the response
 * was corrupted. In these cases, the associated message will be the plain text body of the
 * response, or an empty string if the body is empty or not decodable as plain text.
